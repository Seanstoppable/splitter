<p>The tomtom.splitter.layer7 package contains the implementation for an
    nio-based splitter proxy, based on JBoss Netty.</p>

<p>The {@link tomtom.splitter.layer7.Proxy} object is the entrypoint to the
    system; it creates a server socket and dispatches requests.</p>

<p>Each request gets its own instance of {@link
    tomtom.splitter.layer7.InboundHandler}</p>
